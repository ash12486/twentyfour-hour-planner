# twentyfour-hour-planner

## DESCRIPTION
This is a basic work-day planner that allows the user to save text on each hour block. The block colors reflect past times (grey), present times (orange), and future times (green). Once text is saved it is saved in locagestorage, and will stay there until the browser is closed.
